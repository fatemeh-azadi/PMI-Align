it's a fact that a fat man , particularly a man who's been fat from birth and childhood , isn't quite like other men .
he asked me to come see him .
i looked up at those twin kites .
he would wag his finger and point us out to down from the tree .
intricate mosaic tiles , handpicked by baba in isfahan , covered the floors of the four bathrooms .
i'd sit by the door , knees drawn to my chest .
on the other end of the dining room was a tall marble fireplace , always lit by the orange glow of a fire in the wintertime .
i went past the rosebushes to baba's mansion , hassan was returning to the mud shack where he had been born , where he'd lived his entire life .
hassan never talked about his mother , as if she'd never existed .
hey , you ! he said i know you .
i took her from behind by that creek over there .
he took you for someone else , i whispered he took you for someone else .
but polio had left ali with a twisted , atrophied right leg that was sallow skin over bone with little in between except a paper thin layer of muscle .
he didn't say anything not then , not ever .
then one day , i was in baba's study , looking through his stuff , when i found one of my mother's old history books .
the book said a lot of things i didn't know , things my teachers hadn't mentioned .
but despite sharing ethnic heritage and family blood , sanaubar joined the neighborhood kids in taunting ali .
no obstetricians , no anesthesiologists , no fancy monitoring devices .
what did he sing , hassan and i always asked , though we already knew ali had told us countless times .
but no one ever doubted the veracity of any stories about baba .
i heard the story through rahim khan .
i was eight by then .
we sat at a picnic table on the banks of the lake , just baba and me , eating boiled eggs with kofta sandwiches meatballs and pickles embraced in bread the water was a deep blue and sunlight glittered on its looking glass clear surface .
sunlight twinkled in its side view mirror .
he motioned to me to hold his hat for him and i was glad to , because then everyone would see that he was my father , my baba .
so baba proved them all wrong by not only running his own business but also becoming one of the richest merchants in kabul .
he told us one day that islam considered drinking a terrible sin ; those who drank would answer for their sin on the day of qiyamat , judgment day .
i see you've confused what you're learning in school with practical education , he said in his thick voice but if what he said is true then does it make you a sinner , baba .
but mullah fatiullah khan seems nice , i managed between bursts of tittering .
i mean to speak to you like two men .
i didn't want to disappoint him again .
when baba was six , a thief walked into my grandfather's house in the middle of the night .
and if i ever cross paths with him , God help him do you understand .
because by the time i was eleven , i could recite dozens of verses from khayyam , h√£fez , or rumi's famous masnawi one time .
now that was something to be passionate about .
when it became abundantly clear that i hadn't inherited a shred of his athletic talents , he settled for trying to turn me into a passionate spectator .
we watched from the upper bleachers as riders pounded past us at full gallop , yipping and yelling , foam flying from their horses mouths .
i remember how baba's hands clenched around the steering wheel .
baba's sound was frustrated , almost angry .
sometimes i look out the window and i see him playing on the street with the neighborhood boys .
you know what always happens when the neighborhood boys tease him .
as usual you're oversimplifying .
he lowered his voice , but i heard him anyway .
that boy was ali .
never mind that to me , the face of afghanistan is a boy with a thin boned frame , a shaved head , and low set ears , a boy with a chinese doll face perpetually lit by a harelipped smile .
we chased the kochi , the nomads who passed through kabul by way of the mountains of the north .
we talked about whatever film we had just seen and walked amid the bustling crowds of bazarris .
one summer day , i used one of ali's kitchen knives to carve our names on it : amir and hassan , the sultans of kabul .
we sat for hours under that tree , sat there until the sun faded in the west , and still hassan insisted we had enough daylight for one more story , one more chapter .
well , everyone in my school knows what it means , i said .
i would tell myself that was enough for amends a harmless prank .
however , didn't all fathers in their secret hearts a desire to kill their sons .
what are you doing ? i said .
i had read him a lot of stories .
it took me thirty minutes .
his glare made my throat feel dry .
air grew heavy damp , almost solid .
baba shrugged and stood up .
he smile and winked .
i enjoyed your story very much .
bravo your friend , rahim .
when i read the last sentence , he made a muted clapping sound with his hands .
the word he started , he broke off .
but i never got to finish that sentences .
ali wrap his arms around us .
hassan was crying .
if his work didn't finish yet , then at least it was the beginning of the end .
we let him embrace us in his arms and for a brief insane moment , i was glad about whatever had happened that night .
i shrugged i don't know .
my smile broadened .
assef and two of his friends , wali and kamal , were approaching us .
i saw him use those knuckles once on a kid from the karteh char district .
they stood before us , three tall boys dressed in jeans and T-shirts .
in reality , i had no idea if that was true or not .
tell him what i told my mother about hitler .
i didn't know who they were his mean and what truth they were hiding and i didn't want to find out .
he'd tell me anyway ; assef always answered his own questions .
afghanistan for pashtuns , i say .
just let us go , assef , i said , hating the way my voice trembled .
wali and kamal nodded and grunted in agreement .
but if so , then why , when baba's friends came to visit with their kids , i didn't include hassan in our games .
he really meant to hurt me .
in the cup was a rock the size of a walnut .
maybe you didn't notice , but there are three of us and two of you .
he said this so flatly that even i had to strain to hear the fear that i knew hid under that calm voice .
what he found in it must have convinced him of the seriousness of hassan's intentions , because he lowered his fist .
i watched them walked down the hill and disappeared behind a wall .
for a while , a sense of rejuvenation and purpose swept across the land .
early that following winter of 1974 , hassan and i were playing in the yard one day , building a snow fort , when ali called hassan in .
come on , ali , tell us , i insisted .
for a while , he used to ask hassan what he wanted , but afterward he gave up doing that .
hassan and i traded blank looks .
baba gazed at ali's wary and puzzled eyes .
we both looked at ali , but of course he would never tell any things .
he cleared his throat .
the doctor had given me the same words and assured me that it wouldn't hurt one bit .
ali held his hand as hassan took a long , thoughtful look into it .
soon , it was just a jagged line running up from his lip .
i put a handful of the fresh snow into my mouth , listen to the muffled stillness which is broken only by the cawing of crows .
for a few unfortunate kids , winter did not the end of the school year .
i waited until they pulled away , turned the corner , then i slipped back into bed in my flannel pajamas .
kites were the one paper thin slice of intersection between those spheres .
for a while , hassan and i used to build our own kites .
the next day , we'd won the battle and we fastened ready line around a wooden spool .
but he made the best kites of the city , working out of a tiny hovel on jadeh maywand , the crowded street south of the muddy banks of the kabul river .
people gathered on sidewalks and roofs to cheer for their kids .
afghans cherish custom , but abhor rules .
one year a neighborhood kid climbed a pine tree for a kite .
tense muscles were ready to uncoil .
i chased him through neighborhoods , jumped the creeks and went through narrow Ghighaj streets .
i saw we have ended up on a rough dirt road near isteqial middle school .
hassan popped a mulberry in his mouth .
you'd do that .
we sat there , two boys under a sour cherry tree , suddenly looking , really looking , at each other .
by today , i find it hard to gaze directly at people like hassan , people who mean every word they say .
hassan returned the smile to me .
but they were wasting their time .
one night in winter , only four days remained to the big contest , baba and i sat in his study in overstuffed leather chairs by the glow of the fireplace .
actually , i was a very good rival .
i pretended to listen .
i let myself dream : i imagined conversation and laughter over dinner instead of silence broken only by the clinking of silverware and the occasional grunt .
i smiled , nodded in the right places .
hassan put away the six and picked up the jacks .
i remembered something my teacher had said that summer about iranians , that they were grinning smooth who patted you on the back with one hand and picked your pocket with the other .
i'll put it on my table , where i keep my drawings , hassan said .
i picked up the king and played with my final card , the ace of spades .
we were at ghargha lake , you , me , father , agha sahib , rahim khan , and thousands of other people , he said .
i'll show you all and before anyone can stop you , you dive into the water , start swimming away .
they had noticed now .
i sipped some tea .
in upstairs , i could hear the water running in baba's bathroom .
kids were flinging snowballs , squabbling , chasing one another , giggling .
he wore black rubber snow boots and a bright green chapan over a thick sweater and faded corduroy pants .
this would be failure on a grand scale , even for me .
there's no monster , this is just a beautiful day .
he closed his eyes .
but whether this dream was made up or not , the dream had lifted some of my anxiety .
but when a koran ayat i had learned in my diniyat class rose to my lips , i muttered it .
a cold breeze wafted through my hair .
that was the thing about kite flying , your mind drifted with the kite .
up and down the streets , kite runners were returning triumphantly , their captured kites held high .
i'd made it to the last dozen .
i counted eleven , hassan said .
i'd never felt so in command , so lucky it felt intoxicating .
music blasted .
and suddenly , so easily , hope became knowledge .
the crowd sensed the end was at hand .
hassan was screaming and his arm was embraced around my neck .
the breeze rustled waft his light brown hair .
i get dressed i wait for baba i give up him .
he was breaking our embrace , he said : i know , inshallah , we'll celebrate later .
i was pulling my kite back as people rushed to congratulate me .
he stuck his hand through the bars congratulations , he said .
heads would turn and eyes would lock toward me .
four streets south of ours , i saw omar , an engineer's son who was a baba's friend .
i mean , with those tight little eyes , how does he see anything ?
someone flung open the tarpaulin hanging over the back of the truck , and three faces apeared in .
his eyes settled on the young woman wearing the black shawl .
the young woman pulled the shawl down over her face .
that was when baba stood up .
shame make no sense in the war .
what did he say ?
i was seeing assef's buttock muscles clenching and unclenching by every movment .
he turned to the grinning soldier .
it was from the muzzle of his upturned gun that smoke swirled .
he gave the younger officer the rueful look of a father who is exasperated with his misbehaving son .
we rolled into jalalabad about an hour before sunrise .
baba's hands had embraced around his neck .
none of the roommates knew , that was baba wasn't joking .
no , that was not next door , it was from below .
karim flinched but said nothing .
a low murmur buzzed through the basement , beneath it the sound of water drops trickling somewhere , and , something else , a scratching sound .
one of the refugees asked baba why he wasn't joining them .
but when he and his father came over to our side of the room and i saw kamal's face .
there is another option , karim said , his voice rising amid the groans .
he emptied the box and picked up a handful of dirt from the middle of the unpaved road .
your mouth closes and your lips purses and all you can manage is a strangled croak .
i looked right , left , up , down , waved my hands before my eyes , but i didn't see so much as a hint of movement .
and then a small miracle happened .
someone would burped .
hassan and i stand ankle deep in untamed grass , i am tugging the string , the spool spinning in hassan's calloused hands , our eyes turned up to the kite in the sky .
i didn't remember what month that was , or what year even .
through the upside down v between his legs , i saw the truck idling on the side of the road , the other refugees climbing down the rear ladder .
someone else said it , too .
karim uttered a surprised cry and backpedaled .
baba loved the idea of america .
in 1980 , when we were still in kabul , the u s announced it would be boycotting the olympic games in moscow .
most of our neighbors in fremont were bus drivers , policemen , gas station attendants , and unwed mothers who collected welfare , exactly the sort of blue collar people who would soon suffocate under the pillow reganomics pressed to their faces .
i watched baba jaywalk across fremont boulevard and enter fast & easy , a little grocery store run by an elderly vietnamese couple , mr. and mrs. nguyen .
nguyen's arms embraced around his wife's waist .
does he think i'm a thief ? baba said , his voice was rising .
i'll take him home .
i gave mrs. nguyen our telephone number and address and told her to make an estimate for the damages .
he'd carve notches on our stick with his knife , one notch for each loaf of naan he'd pull for us from the tandoor's roaring flames .
a year and a half since we'd stepped off the boeing from peshawar and baba hadn't still adjusted himself to live in this country .
for baba , a place to mourn his memories .
peshawar was good for me not good for you .
i thought of all the trucks , train sets , and bikes he'd bought me in kabul now america .
baba dropped the stack of food stamps on her desk thank you but i don't want , baba said i work always .
baba walked out of the welfare office like a man cured of a cancer .
he motioned for me to wear my mortarboard , and took a picture of me with the school's clock tower in the background .
help me out to save some money , maybe i go to college the following year .
tonight i am too much happy , he announced to no one and everyone .
men shook his hand and clapped him on the back .
baba bought another round of pitchers for everyone .
he had his hand to his coat pocket and handed me a set of keys .
my eyes were tearing over and i was glad for the shadows that hid our faces .
thanks , i repeated instead of these .
he was drinking cold black tea and chewing cardamom seeds , his personal trusted antidote for hang over headaches .
they pay for that , making up stories .
he took a deep breath and sipped his tea .
pencil gray chain link fences closed off the most of backyards in our neighborhood .
the first time i saw the pacific ocean , i almost cried .
america was different .
we took in our seats , laughed until tears rolled down our cheeks , and , more important , until we were sure the neighbors weren't watching anymore .
we haggled over old sewing machines , one eyed barbie dolls , wooden tennis rackets , guitars with missing strings , and old electrolux vacuum cleaners .
the only thing that flowed more than tea in those aisles was afghan gossip .
he smelled like cologne and wore an iron gray three piece suit , shiny from too many pressings ; the gold chain of a pocket watch dangled from his vest .
well , people need stories to divert them at difficult times like this .
this little speech sounded to me the way his suit looked : often used and unnaturally shiny .
she was standing behind us , a slim hipped beauty with velvety coal black hair , an open thermos and styrofoam cup in her hand .
she walked to a dull gray van two aisles away and put the thermos inside .
for the rest of that day , i fought with myself not to look toward the gray van .
i rolled my eyes .
baba sighed .
ali swore that if you ate watermelon the night of yelda , you wouldn't get thirsty the coming summer .
and i'd have to will my eyes not to peel away , not to wander to where soraya sat reading a paperback .
despite the sun burning down like a branding iron , the market was crowded that day and sales had been strong it was only 12 : 30 but we'd already made $ 160 .
honor and pride the tenets of pashtun men .
she was alone and reading book .
my ears were burning .
i will go now .
i held my breath .
but i'd asked her a question that if she answered , we'd be .
when she saw us , her eyes bounced from soraya to me and back .
you know , your grandfather , ghazi shahib , the judge .
but he wouldn't say more baba knew how idle talk could jeopardize a young woman's prospects of marrying well .
they're sweet and fresh .
i began to make some thing up , but he bit into a peach and waved his hand .
as if her presence legitimized whatever was happening between us though certainly not to the same degree that the general's would have .
my mother was a teacher too , she taught farsi and history at zarghoona high school for girls in kabul .
she gave me this big smile , crinkling her eyes , and said she'd like that very much .
i thought of how i had used my literacy to ridicule hassan .
i fished the roll of stapled pages from my back pocket .
what a beautiful day , isn't it ?
you know , bachem , i have fond of you .
he dropped his hand and smiled again .
he got over the sneezing , but the cough persisted .
even though baba was a manager at the gas station , the owner hadn't offered him health insurance , and baba , in his recklessness , hadn't insisted .
he began scribbling again .
he handed me the referral form .
i used it as a prayer rug .
dr. schneider said russia .
i'm sorry , doctor , as if this isn't going to work out .
dr. amani bit his lip , used the word grave .
don't quarrel with me in public , amir .
what about me , baba ? what am i supposed to do ? i said , my eyes welling up .
all those years , that's what i was trying to teach you , how never have to ask that question .
i didn't know what or whom he was defying .
the general always was the diplomat , greeted me with a smile and his two handed shake .
sometimes at the flea market , afghan acquaintances made remarks about baba's weight loss .
i ran to baba .
he had bitten his tongue .
he put the films up on a viewing box in the hallway and pointed with the eraser end of his pencil to the pictures of baba's cancer , like a cop showing mug shots of the killer to the victim's family .
i spent the night sitting on a chair next to baba's bed .
the general smiled him back , too .
the way he was looking at me was strange , the kindness in his eyes .
her hair was down .
our first touch .
she turned to go .
i thanked them , signed their forms , and took baba home by the ford torino .
i sat beside him .
then give me the phone .
he listened for a while .
it's an honorable matter in advance . .
i helped him into a clean white shirt and knotted his tie for him , noted how his collar and shoulder are loosed .
i helped baba out of the ford and slipped back behind the wheel .
he was baba .
i switched hands the phone .
you need to know .
we lived together for almost a month .
i heard her put the phone down .
she paused .
i want you to marry me .
i checked my tie in the rearview mirror .
they're here ! i heard a woman's voice say the chatter stopped .
a photo of the general , dashing in full military outfit , shaking hands with king hussein of jordan a portrait of zahir shah .
we sat in the crowded room , baba and i next to each other , across from the general and his wife .
baba cleared his own throat .
amirjan is my only son .
i admired you humbly in kabul and this respect remains so today .
he dressed in a stunning winecolored traditional afghan dress with long sleeves and gold trimmings .
then an engagement period would have followed which would have lasted a few months .
he rented a large afghan banquet hail in fremont the man who owned it knew dad from kabul and gave him a substantial discount .
we said our oaths and signed the certificates .
one of soraya's cousins , sharif jan's son , held a koran over our heads as we inched along .
tea flowed once more and music played until the neighbors called the cops .
it was rather like a larger sort of dog .
a barber .
fetch barber to concord .
when a gentleman of sixty , formally dressed in a brown suit of clothes , which pretty well worn , but very well had been kept .
as though it pitted its gravity and longevity against the levity and evanescence of the brisk fire .
it was as white as the tops of the waves that broke upon the neighbouring beach .
perhaps second hand cares , like second hand clothes , come easily off and on .
please let me know .
not of late years .
you might treble that , and say a hundred and fifty , yet not be far from the truth .
it ran its head into the chalk cliffs .
the air among the city was of so strong a piscatory flavour that one might have supposed sick fish went up to be dipped in it , as people went down to be dipped in the sea .
as the day declined into the afternoon .
had just poured out his last glassful of wine with as complete an appearance of satisfaction as is ever to be found in an elderly gentleman of a fresh complexion who has got to the end of a bottle , when a rattling of wheels came up the narrow .
required none then .
loaded with heavy dark tables .
a young lady of not more than seventeen .
on the frame of which , a hospital procession of negro cupids , several headless and all cripples , were offering black baskets of dead sea fruit to black divinities of the feminine gender .
either word will do .
she curtseyed to him ( young ladies made curtseys in those days ) , with a pretty desire to convey to him that she felt how much older and wiser he was than she .
the gentleman had left london .
i naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are .
she raised her hand .
if you please , sir .
he seemed willfully to mistake the word she had repeated .
like monsieur manette , your father , the gentleman was of beauvais .
i speak , miss , of twenty years ago .
i begin to think .
using his right by turns to rub his chin , pull his wig at the ears , or point what he said .
feelings .
now comes the difference .
a matter of business .
if his wife had implored the king , the queen , the court , the clergy , for any tidings of him , and all quite in vain .
you are collected .
miss , if the poor lady had suffered so intensely before her little child was born .
let us be clear headed .
the hands that had not ceased to clasp his wrists were so much more steady than the had been .
when she died .
you know that your parents had no great possession .
greatly changed .
she said , in a low , distinct , awe stricken voice , as if she were saying it in a dream .
said mr. lorry , laying stress upon it as a wholesome means of enforcing her attention .
better not to mention the subject , anywhere or in any way .
she does not notice a word .
therefore he called out loudly for assistance without moving .
why , look at you all .
calling her my precious ! and my bird .
while the strong woman .
replied the strong woman .
it lay on the stones just outside the door of the wine shop , shattered like a walnut shell .
even with handkerchiefs from women's heads , which were squeezed dry into infants mouths .
so much mud got taken up along with it .
which led , especially among the luckier .
these demonstrations ceased , as suddenly as they had broken out .
it had stained many hands , too , and many faces .
one tall joker so besmirched .
the darkness of it was heavy .
fluttered in every vestige of a garment that the wind shook .
hunger was repeated in every fragment of the small modicum of firewood that the man sawed off .
its abiding place was in all things fitted to it .
the trade signs ( and they were almost as many as the shops ) were , all , grim illustrations of want .
broke off abruptly at the doors .
hoisted them again .
hauling up men by those ropes and pulleys , to flare upon the darkness of their condition .
the people from the market did it .
what now .
with one of his stained shoes jerked off his foot into his hand , and held out .
for , although it was a bitter day , he wore no coat .
a man not desirable to be met , rushing down a narrow pass with a gulf on either side .
thus engaged , with her right elbow supported by her left hand .
other company were there .
but , he feigned not to notice the two strangers .
madame defarge , picking her teeth with her toothpick .
the last of the three now said his say , as he put down his empty drinking vessel and smacked his lips .
kept her eyebrows up .
took up her knitting with great apparent calmness and repose of spirit .
near to the window of my establishment .
willingly , sir .
mr. jarvis lorry and miss manette , emerging from the wine shop thus .
he had no good humour in his face , nor any openness of aspect left .
is he always alone , then .
mutter a tremendous curse .
the room or rooms within every door that opened on the general staircase left its own heap of refuse on its own landing .
by which any languishing good airs that were left uncorrupted .
the keeper of the wine shop , always going a little in advance .
was the grim reply of monsieur defarge .
exclaimed mr. lorry .
not a word of it had reached the young lady's ears .
they went up slowly and softly .
leave us , good boys .
i think it is well .
looked in through the crevice in the wall .
a faint voice answered something .
i am afraid of it , she answered , shuddering .
took out the key again .
one half of this door was fast closed .
it is considered a fact that fat person specially who has been fat from birth and he was fat in his chilhood period , actually not quite like other people .
he asked me to come and see him .
i looked at the pair kites .
he from top of the tree moved his finger to sign of rejection for us .
floor of every four water closet with similar mosaics reduced , that was hand picked by father in esfahan , was covered .
i was sitting near the door , and i had been hugging the knees .
another side of dining room was a tall fireplace with marble facade , that in winter always was firing with orange lavas .
i go to father's mansion and hassan go to clay cottage where his hometown , where he had spent all of his life , we crossed rose plants .
hassan never talked about his mother , as if she never has been .
he said : hey , you ! i know you .
i put him from back to near a brook that was there .
he took you for someone else , i whispered he took you for someone else .
but palsy disease , was thinned and curved ali's right leg , indeed within his bones wasn't anything except a small sheet thin layer of muscle that was covered by a yellow skin .
he didn't say anything , not that time , not ever .
one day i was in my father's studying room and i was searching in his means that i found one of my mother's old history books .
the book had a lot of contact that i didn't know them , which my teachers didn't teach them .
in despite of shared family heritage and sanaubar be of inbreeding mocking ali link neighborhood kids together .
no midwife , no anesthetic , no thought didn't control on tools .
hassan and i always asked , what he sings , although we knew because ali was repeatedly told us .
but no one could doubt the authenticity of any story about father .
i heard the story through rahim khan .
when i was 8 years old .
we sat on the picnic table near the beach lake , only father and i , ate boiled eggs and meatball sandwiches meat and pickles wrapped in bubble bread water up to high depth was blue and the sunlight was flourishing in its mirror that was a clear surface .
the sunlight was flourishing besides his namely the same mirror .
my dad came toward me to keep his hat and i was happy , because since then all saw that he is my father .
so dad proved to all of them that they were wrong because not only launched his business but also was one of the richest merchants in kabul .
someday he told us that islam is considered punishment for sin such as everyone is committed to this in the judgment day should be held accountable for their sins .
he said with his hoarse voice : i understand that you have been confused by what you learn in school as proper training .
i said between laughter by laughter , but fatiullah khan seems a good man .
i mean that we talk together as the two men .
i did not want to disappoint him again .
when dad was six years old , at midnight a thief went into the house my grandfather .
if i got through with his directions it was god who had helped him do you understand .
that's because when i was eleven years , i could recite from memory the poetry from khayyam , hafez , or masnawi .
once now that there was something for intolerance about him .
when it became clear that i even bit his athlete's character , did not inherit he tried to convert me to the audience fanatics .
we saw from the top row of seats that the riders was rushing and was leaving us out as a particle , was cheering and was shouting , and the floor was thrown from their horses mouth .
i remember how my dad's hands are tied to the handlebar .
dad seemed disappointed and almost angry .
sometimes i take a look threw the window and i saw him with the neighbor boys is playing in the street .
you know when the neighbor boys always mocked him what happened .
as usual , you oversimplify the issue .
he was slow , however , i heard his voice .
that boy was ali .
anyway , this point that the face of afghanistan looks as a slim boy's face to me , with a shaved head and a flappy corner , a boy with the face of chinese dolls that is adorned with harelip smile continuously .
we were going after gypsies , who passed through kabul on their way to the mountains of the north .
we talked about all of the new movie that we had seen , we crossed the busy crowds of people marketers .
a summer day , i used one of ali's kitchen knives to carve on it : amir and hassan , the kings of kabul .
we sat for hours under the tree , until the sun disappeared in the west , and still hassan insisted we had enough daylight for one more story , one more chapter .
well , everyone in my school knows what it means , i said .
i told to myself that for a harmless joke was compensated enough .
afterwards , other fathers secret hearts harbor a desire to not kill their sons .
what are you doing ? i said .
i had read a lot of stories for him .
it took me thirty minutes .
his gaze dried my throat .
the air had been steamed strongly had been almost solid .
dad shrugged shoulder and stood up .
he smiled and also winked .
i really enjoyed your story .
congratulations , to your friend , rahim .
when i read the last sentence , quietly with his hands hit the floor .
he left unfinished the word had started .
but i never could get that sentence to the end .
ali wrapped his arms around us .
hassan was crying .
if he still doesn't keep quiet , so the new was the beginning of the end .
we let him to take us to embrace , and for a short moment and like crazy , i was happy about everything that had happened that night .
i shrugged my shoulder and said i don't know .
my smile was more .
assef and two of his friends , wali and kamal , were closing to us .
i saw once that what he did with a boy from the neighborhood of karate char by that brass knuckles .
they stood before us , three tall boys with jeans and t shirts .
in fact , i didn't have any idea it was right or not .
what i said about hitler to my mother say to him .
i did not know who they are and they hide what truth and i didn't want to know .
assef had always answered his questions , however , he will say to me .
i am saying afghanistan for pashtuns .
i said , assef , just let us to go , and he hated my voice from shaking .
wali and kamal shaked their heads and set out to confirmation .
if it is so , then why , when father's friends with their children came to visit , i didn't let hassan to play with us .
his purpose really was that bothers me .
in the cup was a rock with the size of walnuts .
perhaps you didn't pay attention , but there's three of our and two of you .
he explicitly stated this subject that even i had to do much work to hear a fear that has hidden in the calm voice .
what he found in that caused to be convinced of the seriousness of the hassan's aims , because he brought down his handful .
i saw them going down the hill and disappeared behind a wall .
for a few time all the land was new life and was targeted .
in early of next winter , namely 1974 , one day hassan and i were playing in the garden , we were building a snow castle , when ali said him come here .
ali , tell us please i insist .
for a moment , he decided that what he wanted making the request from hassan , but had dispensed .
hassan and i exchanged causeless looks .
dad , saw the ali's precaution and his staggered eyes .
we both looked to ali , but of course you never could not say so despite his .
straight his throat .
the doctor told me the same too , gave me confidence that i will not hurt a bit .
when hassan looked at it long and thoughtful , ali took his hand very soon pink something was eaten and fell down from his lip .
soon , just a jagged line on his lips could be seen .
i poured my mouth a handful of fresh snow and i was listening to uniform silence that was broken only by crows caw .
for a few number of star crossed students , winter was not end of course of school .
until they withdraw , i have waited , then with woolen pajamas i returned to my bed .
kite is a thin piece of paper that has made from confluence of some areas .
for a while , hassan and i are making ourselves kite .
in next day , we want to win the race starting line in whole of wooden pulley .
but he was famous kite maker of city too , that works in small cottage in maywand street , crowded street in south of muddy beach of kabul river .
people have gathered in sidewalks and roofs for encouragement of their children's .
the afghans cherish the tradition but they afraid of laws .
one year of the district children's elevated a pine tree for making the kite .
the muscles is ready for uncoil .
i chased him through districts , jump between dales , and confluence of narrow streets .
i saw that we finished dirt road near to isteqial high school .
hassan put blackberry in his mouth .
you would do that work .
we has sat there , two boys under sour cherry tree , suddenly looked together .
to this day , hardly can stare to someone like hassan , the people that have a mean in every words that they say .
hassan returned the smile .
but they waste their time .
a winter night , just was four days until race day , baba and i had sat in study room on leather chair that was shining from fire of fireplace .
indeed a very good case .
i pretended to listen .
i think , dialogue and boff in dinner instead of a silence that just with noises of silver dishes and occasional snoring break .
i simile , head shake , and laughed at all the right places .
hassan killed six and picked up the jack .
i remember my teacher in summer had said about iranian , they grin who hit with his hand to your back and remove your wallet .
i put it on my desk , where i keep my paints hassan said .
i put my king card and played with last card , spade .
he said we were in ghargha lake , you , me , father , mr. sahib , rahim khan , and thousands other .
i show for all of you and before one stop you , dive into water and swim .
now they see .
i drank a little tea .
in upstairs , i heard the sound of flow of water of father's bath .
children's were throwing the snowballs and make noise , gasp .
he wear black rubber boots with light green chapan on thick sweater and wear velvet stripe pants .
this plan can great scale face failure , even for me .
there is no strange thing , just a good day .
he closed his eyes .
it is artificial or not , my foolish dream seems wary .
when a quran verse i read in religious class ‚Ä¶ , i hum it .
cold breeze was crossing through my hairs .
a point about fly of kite : your mind flows with kite .
up and down of street , kite players returned victorious , they had took their kites upper .
i have done it to the end .
hassan said , i counted it to eleventh .
i have not good feeling as drunkenness , even intuit .
damn music .
and suddenly very easy expectance to become a knowledge .
population understood that end is close .
hassan was screaming and his arm was wrapped around my neck .
breeze was moving his light brown hair .
wear your clothes wait for dad give in .
i know he said , breaking our embrace inshallah , we'll celebrate later .
i began to pull my kite back as people rushed to congratulate me .
his hands stick among slat he said : congratulation .
heads would turn to me and eyes would stare at me .
four streets south of ours , i saw omar , the son of an engineer who was my father's friend .
i mean , with those tight little eyes , how does he see anything .
someone flung open the tarpaulin hanging over the back of the truck , and three faces appeared in .
his eyes settled on the young woman who is wearing the black scarf .
the young woman pulled the scarf down over her face .
when dad stood .
there is no shame in war .
what did he say ?
assef's buttock muscles clenching and unclenching , his hips thrusting back and forth .
he made fun of soldiers .
from the upward mouth of his pistol , was smoke coming .
he looks the young officer like a sad father who is angry his son .
we rolled into jalalabad about an hour before sunrise .
dad's hands were wrapped around his neck .
none of those who were in the room didn't know the father wasn't joking .
no , it was not from the adjacent room , it was from following .
karim flinched but said nothing .
a low murmur buzzed through the basement , beneath it the sound of water drops trickling somewhere , and , something else , a scratching sound .
one of the refugees asked baba why he wasn't joining them .
but when he and his father came over to our side of the room and i saw kamal's face .
kamal said : there is another option , he raised his voice among shriekes .
he emptied the box and picked up a handful of dirt from the middle of the unpaved road .
your mouth closes and your lips purse and all you can manage is a strangled croak .
i looked right , left , up , down , waved my hands before my eyes , didn't see so much as a hint of movement i blinked , blinked again nothing at all .
then a small miracle .
someone retched .
hassan and i stand ankle deep in untamed grass , i am tugging on the line , the spool spinning in hassan's calloused hands , our eyes turned up to the kite in the sky .
i didn't remember what month that was , or what year even .
through the upside down v between his legs , i saw the truck idling on the side of the road , the other refugees climbing down the rear ladder .
somebody else said this too .
karim uttered a surprised cry and retreat .
baba loved the idea of america .
in 1980 , when we were still in kabul , the u.s. announced it would be boycotting the olympic games in moscow .
most of our neighbors in fremont were bus drivers , under the pillow reganomics pressed to their faces policemen , gas station attendants , and unwed mothers collecting welfare , exactly the sort of blue collar people who would soon .
i watched him jaywalk across fremont boulevard and enter fast & easy , a little grocery store run by an elderly couple , mr. and mrs. nguyen .
mr. nguyen had his hands around his wife's waist .
does he think i'm a thief ? baba said , his voice rising .
i took him home .
i gave him phone number and address and told him that estimate the damage .
he'd carve notches on our stick with his knife , one notch for each loaf of _ naan _ he'd pull for us from the tandoor's roaring flames .
it has tooken one and half since we got off boeing from peshawar in united state and dady still hasn't adopted himself with living in this country .
for dad , somewhere to lament for him .
peshawar was good for me not good for you .
i thought of all the trucks , train sets , and bikes he'd bought me in kabul now it's america .
dad put the food on the table , thanks but i don't want it i'm always working , said dad .
dad left the social services like a sick person leaving his tumor behind .
he pointed at me to wear the college's cap and take my picture that the clock tower of the school was in his background .
helping , saving money , so that maybe he went to college the next year .
i'm very happy tonight , he announced to everyone and no one in particular .
he shook her hand and put his hand on her back .
dad bought another round of beer for all of us .
he put his hand in his coat's pocket and gave me the keys .
there were tears in my eyes and i was happy that our faces were hidden by the shadows .
instead of these i repeat again : thanks .
he was drinking cold tea and chewing cardamom seeds , he personally believed in opium for relieving headaches .
they are paying money for that , building stories .
he took a deep breath and drank his tea .
a chain of connected fences was blocking the gray sticks in backyards of our neighborhood .
the first time i saw the pacific ocean , i nearly cried .
the US was different .
we sank in our seats , laughing until there were tears running down our faces , and most importantly , when we were sure the neighbors weren't looking anymore .
we were haggling over old sewing machines , barbie dolls with one eye , wooden tennis rackets , string less guitars and old elegant vacuum cleaner .
the only thing flowing around the corridors more than the smell of tea , was the Afqani's rumor .
he smelled of cologne and wore a three piece gray suit , bright under a lot of pressure ; a golden chain of a pocket watch was hanging on his jacket .
very well , people needed stories that held their attentions in different times like this .
this short conversation evoked his suits for me : mostly the second group and unnatural sparkle .
she was standing behind us , a skinny beautiful girl with soft black hair , an open thermos and a styrofoam cup in her hands .
he walked to a scrapped gray truck two ways further and put the thermos away .
for the rest of the day i fought the desire of staring at the gray truck .
i rolled my eyes .
dad sighed .
ali swore that if you'd eaten watermelon on yalda night , you wouldn't be thirsty in the summer .
i was very careful not to be surprised , when watching Soraia as she was sitting and reading a book .
even though the sun was shining like a hot iron , the bazar was very crowded that day and the sales were having a blast , it was 12:30 but we only got 160 $ so far .
with pride and arrogance the , beliefs of Pashtoo people .
he was alone and reading .
my ears were burning .
i will be going now .
i held my breath .
but i'd asked him a question and if he'd answered , we would have become .
when he saw us , his eyes skipped to me and back to Soraya again .
you know , your grandfather , judge Sahib , judge .
but he didn't say anything else , father knew how rubbish words could make a young woman's logical marriage .
they are sweet and lively .
i started making something , but he bit the peach and waved his hand , don't do that Amir .
it seemed his presence made what was happening between us gave a legitimate aspect although not as much as general presence .
my mom was also a teacher , she was teaching girls in Zarghoone school in Kabol history and Farsi language .
he smiled at me , rolling his eyes , and said he liked them very much .
i thought of how to use my knowledge to humiliate Hassan .
i took out a few folded and stapled papers out pants back pocket .
what a beautiful day , no .
you know , with bachem , i am falling in love with you .
he dropped his hand , smiling again .
he held his sneezing , but couldn't stop the coughs .
although father was the manager of a gas station , the owner wasn't providing him with health insurance and father , with his lack of attention , hadn't insisted .
began scribing again .
he gave me the submission form .
i used it as a prayer rug .
Russia , Dr. Schneider said .
i am sorry , doctor , he does not work anymore .
Dr. Amini bite his lips and used the word tomb .
please do not reprimand me before others , Amir .
how about me ? what am i supposed to do ? crying i siad .
all those years i tried to teach you something and why should you not ask that thing .
i did not know to who and what he equated himself .
with a laugh , the general and even the diplomat greeted and we shaked hands .
sometimes in the second hand store Afghan's talked about dad's getting thin .
i run to dad .
he was biting his tongue .
he put the box on a shelf in the corridor and with the little eraser on the tip of his pencil pointed to the photos of dad's cancer , just like a police who shows the murdered family the photos of murderer .
i spent the night seating by the dad's bed .
the general smiled back .
she was looking at me unusually and her eyes were full of love .
his hair shed .
our first call .
he came back to go .
i said thank you to them , he signed their forms and picked dad up home with my FordTorino .
i sat beside him .
then he gave me the phone .
he listened for a while .
we are looking forward to something nice .
i helped him to wear a white shirt , i knotted his tie and i found that how collar and shoulder of the shirt was became larger for him .
i helped dad get off the Ford and he leaned to the back of the wheel .
he was dad .
i tied my hands firmly .
you have to know .
we have lived together for about a month .
i heard him hanging the phone up .
he paused .
i want to marry each other .
i firmed my ties in front of the car's mirror .
i heard a woman shouting : there are here and the dialogue stopped .
a picture of general in his format military uniform shaking hands with Shah Hussein , the ruler of jordan , caught the eye .
we were in a crowded room dad and i sat next to each other right in front of general and his wife .
dad softed his voice .
Amirjan is my only son .
when i was in kabol i respected you and now i respect you much more .
he wore a traditional cloth with long sleeves and a fabulous red color and golden ornamnets .
then , their engagement period that lasted for a few month started .
he rented a very big hall in Fremont , he knew the owner the time he was in Kabol and that's why he got a good discount .
we took the oath and signed the documents .
when we went step by step , one of Soraya's cousin , son of dear Sharif , Quran was over our heads .
tea was served one more time and the music was played so loud that the nieghbors called the police .
it was a fairly large group of dogs .
a barber .
send the barber out Concord .
when after a while a sixty year old gentleman with brown formal suit , which seemed to be worn out but was taken a good care of .
as if he fortified his dignity for a continued to struggle with shame and unstable turbulent flames .
as the waves that break on the beach adjacent is white .
perhaps the second hand worries like second hand clothes are easily worn and easily put off .
please let me know .
in recent years , not .
you might make it three times bigger , and say one hundred and fifty , yet not far from the truth .
he had his head down in the plaster rocks .
the air within the city was so full of fish odor as if the sick fish had swam in it , like people who go swimming in the sea .
as down slowly turns noon .
as he filled his last cup with a face full of satisfaction the sound of a wheel of a carriage echoed in narrow road and then he roaring attacked guest house's yard .
they didn't need anything else .
high and dark tables were piled .
a young lady , at most seventeen .
mirror that there were cupids of black people on its frame , many headless , in their black baskets they would display their fruits in presence of black gods and soon the mirror disappeared .
any commands will be done .
young ladies in those days had to bow respected him , with a great desire to tell him how much she was proud of him .
the gentleman had leaved london .
i am logically interested to know them .
he raised his hands .
whatever you desire .
mr. lorry seems to confused a word that the young woman had repeat said .
he was a gentleman from bovis , like your father , lord manette .
the conversation is about twenty years ago , lady .
i am thinking little by little .
sometimes he used his right hand to rub his chin , sometimes to fix his wig , and sometimes in emphasizing on a point .
feelings .
this will bring the conflicts .
a matter of business .
if at the time the wife of the doctor had gone to the king for imploredand and would fall upon the queen's feet , and had asked all the royal court for assistance and then asked the clergymen to get any news from her husband , and she did not get anywhere .
you gathered your senses .
well lady , if this helpless woman before the birth of her child had seen so suffering .
let us be clear general .
his hands that still was pressing mr. lorry's cuff , till that pillar was tougher than it had been .
the time of his death .
you know that your parents didn't have a lot of property .
it has altered a lot .
the girl with a down and awe stricken voice , but clear , as if speaking in sleep , said .
mr. lorry to focus the young woman's attention said with emphasis .
nowhere and no way , you had better don't mention it .
he didn't understand a word .
so he yield loudly without any movement for help .
why , look at yourself completely .
called she with words like my jewelry and my bird .
while a strong lady .
powerful woman responded .
now like a broken walnut on the door of tavern had been fallen on the cobble .
even the handkerchief of the women which prevented their children from thirst .
a lot of sludge is drawn out of it .
which one did it show , especially between lucky ones .
the protests were stopped , when they suddenly spread .
this , smudge lots of hands and also lots of face .
a tall joker so mottled .
it was so dark .
the wind shakes the hanging clothes .
dryness is repeated in every small particle of firewood that the man smoothed with saw .
the place abiding whatever he respected .
trading marks which are almost as many as the stores needed frightening descriptions .
the door suddenly stopped .
he lifted them again .
lift the men with ropes and pulleys , in order to inflame in their dark situation .
it was done by people in shop .
what now .
with one of his dirty shoes quickly took his foot to his hand .
although it was a bitter day , he didn't wear a jacket .
it is not pleasant for a man to be seen , rushing on a narrow bridge with whirlpool on both sides .
thus engaged , with her right arm which was holding with his left hand .
there was another company over there .
but he pretended that he didn't notice the two strangers .
madam defarge is picking her tooth with toothpick .
ignoring the three now said his words , he put his empty glass and taste with sound .
kept his eyebrow up .
her knitting was done seemed calmly .
near the window of my place .
with pleasure , sir .
thus , mr. jarvis lorry and miss manette are coming out of the wine store .
his face was others do not affect the mood of optimism and not sign of openness .
is he always alone , then .
whispering an insult .
the room or rooms where the doors are opened to the public stairway , he stayed in his own yard .
how the good faded weather did remain healthy .
the guard of the liquor store always goes a little forward .
was the response of monsieur defarge stern .
mr. lorry shouted .
the young lady didn't hear a word of it .
they went up quietly and softly .
leave us , bye .
i thought this is good .
he looked from hole of the wall .
a somewhat mild voice answered .
i am afraid that , he answered , shaking .
he gained the key again .
a half of this door was fast closed .
of course , that a fat man , especially the one who has been fat since birth and childhood , is completely different from the others .
he asked me to visit him .
i looked at those couple of balloons .
he was shaking his finger , pointing to us to come down from the tree .
the delicate tiles that father has bought from esfahan , cover all the floors of his four bathrooms .
i would sit by the door , feeling blue and depressed .
at the other end of the dining room , there was a tall marble fireplace , which in winters the fire's orange flames would dance in it .
i was passing by the rose gardens , going to father's mansion and hassan would go back to the mud straw hut that he was born in and spent all his life there .
hassan would never talk about his mother , as if she never existed .
hey , you , i know you .
once i brought him to before that canal , there .
i whispered to him , he must have mistaken you with someone else he definitely did .
yet , the polio has left ali with a infirm right leg , which a yellow skin covered its bone and nothing left on it except a thin layer of muscle .
nevertheless , he did not say anything , neither on that time nor later .
one day i went to my father's office and searched through his library to find one of the old history books of my mother's .
there was a lot of stuffs written in that book that i did not know , the things that our teacher never talked about them .
even though , Sanaubar  unlike a common culture and nationality with Ali , she would unite with neighbor kid to sneer him .
there was neither obstetrician nor anesthesia specialist with her and she did not have access to any medical device .
i and Hassan would always ask him what he is reading , even though we already knew , Ali has told us many times .
however , no one would doubt about the truth of the stories that have told about the father .
Rahim khan told me about this matter .
those days , i was eight  years old .
we sat by the lake , on the woody bench only my father and i and we ate the sandwiches of boiled eggs and meatballs with pickles by its side , the water depth was low and the sun had glint on its smooth surface .
the sunlight was glinting in the mirror by her side .
father gave me his hat to keep it for him and i got happy about it , since everybody would see that he was my father .
therefore , not only by improving the business but also by becoming one of the richest businesspersons of Kabul , my father proved to all that they are mistaken .
one day he told us that Islam counts consumption of alcohol as one of the greatest sins ; and those who drinks are responsible for their action by the end of the days .
he said with a thick voice : i see that you mixed the things you learn in school with the practical training if what he said is true , then you are a sinner , father .
among my giggles i said : but Fatiullah Khan seems to be a nice man .
i want to talk to you like two men .
i did not want to disappoint him again .
when my father was six years old , a thief came to my grandfather's house at mid night .
if i see him one more time , god helps him , you understand .
when i was eleven years old , i knew tens of Khayyam , Hafez  and Molavi's poems by heart .
now this is something that would make a man infatuated .
when it becomes clear that he did not inherited any of his athletic talent , he tried to change him to a passionate audience .
from the audiences benches , we were watching the riders gallops that were yelling and the foam from their horses mouths were falling to the ground .
i remember how my father's hands had gripped the steering wheel .
father's voice was cracked and more and less angry .
sometimes i look out from this window and i see him who plays with neighbor kids in the street .
do you know what happens when neighbor kids tease him .
as always , you are not taking the matter seriously .
he brought his voice down , but still i could hear that .
this boy was the same Ali .
anyway , for me the Afghanistan looks like a slim boy with a shaved head and floppy corners , a boy with the face of Chinese dolls that continue to be adorned with harelip smile .
we were going after gypsies  who were passing Kabul in their way to the northern mountains .
we would talk about any new movie that we had seen and we would hang around the tumult of merchants .
one summer day , i took one of the Ali's kitchen's knifes and i carved out our names on it : Amir and Hassan , kings of Kabul .
we would sit under that tree for hours until the sunset ; however , Hassan would insist that we still have time to read one more stories or another chapter .
i said , ok , in our school everybody knows its meaning .
i was saying to myself that this work is enough to make up to him for a harmless prank .
don't all the fathers want to kill their sons .
i said , what are you doing .
i had read him many stories .
it took half an hour .
his staring eyes caused my throat to dry .
the weather was heavy , humid and firm .
the father drew his shoulders up and got up .
with a smile on his face , he twinkled .
i really enjoyed from your story .
well done , your friend , Rahim .
when story finished , he clapped with his hands silently .
he did not finish, what he had started to say .
however i never finished my sentences .
Ali circled his hands around both of us .
Hassan was crying .
and if he is still not done quiet done with the job , at least its running .
we let him to hug us , and i became insanely happy from the short passing moments of what happened that night .
i pull my shoulders up i don't know .
my smile got bigger .
Assef and his two friends , Wali and Kamal , were getting closer to us .
once i saw what he did to a boy from karate char neighborhood with that brass knuckles .
they stood in front of us , three tall boys with jeans and t shirts .
in fact , i did not know if these are Hormat's words or not .
you are saying something to him that i told my mother about Hitler .
i did not know who his mean and why they hiding the truth and i did not wanted to know .
anyway he would have told me , Assef always had answers to his questions .
i am saying that Afghanistan is belonged to Pashtuns .
i was hate that my voice trembling , i said : let us go Assef .
Wali and Kamal shook their heads and roared in approval .
but if it was so , then why when dad's friends would come to us with their children , i would not let Hassan into our plays .
he really aimed to hurt me .
there was a rock with size of a walnut inside the cup .
maybe you did not pay attention , but we are three and you are two .
he said it so calmly that even i had to push myself to discover the fear that was underneath of that calm voice .
probably he see something in Hassan's face  had contented him that he is not joking , since he brought his fist down .
i saw them that were going down of the hill and disappeared behind a wall .
for a period of time , the whole land was targeted and new life .
at the beginning of the next year winter , means 1974 , one day Hassan and i were playing in the yard we were busy building a snow castle that Ali called us .
i persisted , come on Ali , tell us .
for a while , he would asked of Hassan what he wants , but later he stops doing so .
stagger looks exchanged between Hassan and i .
father stared at Ali's opaque and cautious eyes .
we both stared at Ali , but it was obvious that nothing would come out of him .
he cleared his throat .
the doctor told me the same things and ensured me that i would not have pain .
when Hassan was deep in his thoughts , looking at his hand , he to realize that Ali was holding his hand .
it did not take a while that only a dentate line could be seen on his lip .
i put a handful of snow into my mouth and listen to the dead silence that only crows caw would break it .
for some bad luck kids , winter was not the end of the school year .
i would wait until they start to walk and turn , then i would crawled into the bed with my Flunnel pajamas .
kite was the paper thin slice from the intersection of these two areas .
for a while , Hassan and i would make the kites ourselves .
the next day , we would tie for war the ready strings to our wooden spools .
but he made the best kites in the town he lived in a hut by the Maywand road , the crowded street in the southern puddled corners of Kabul river .
people would gathered in the sidewalks and on the roofs to cheer for their sons .
Afghans like the customs and traditions but despite of the rules .
one year , one of the boys went up the pine tree to pull down the kite .
stretched muscles were ready to open .
i would went after Hassan , i would jumped over the brooks and zigzagged in narrow streets .
i saw that we reached the roughness of a dirt road near the Esteghlal secondary school .
Hassan threw a berry into his mouth .
you would do that .
two young boys , we were sitting under sour cherry tree and suddenly we would overthrow each other , indeed we would overthrew .
even today , i find staring at eyes of people like hassan difficult , people whom believe whatever they say .
hassan responded my smile .
however , they would waste their time .
one winter night , when there were only four days remained until the great competition , father and i were sitting in his office by the heater fire on his leather sofas .
indeed i was a tough opponent .
i faked listening .
i was daydreaming : i imagined a day that instead of the silence during dinning , that only the sounds of utensils and silver plates could break it , talking and giggling take place .
i shook my head right on the time , and smiled .
hassan put away the six and took the jack .
i remember that my professors talked about iranians this summer , they would grin at someone who would hit you by the hand and take away your bag .
hassan said : i am gone put it on my desk , the same place i put my drawings .
i took the king and i played with the last card , spade ace .
he described you , i , father , mr. saheb , and rahim khan and thousands of others were indulging by the corner of the lake .
i will show you ; and before anybody can stop you , you dived in to the water and started swimming .
now i realized .
i drank some tea .
i could hear the sound of water from the upstairs bathroom .
children were throwing snow balls to each other they were yelling , running after another and laughing loudly .
he was wearing a pair of black rubber boots for snow , a light green jacket on thick sweater and a pair of old corduroy pants .
this was a huge failure even for me .
there is no monster this is only a beautiful day .
he closed his eyes .
whether this dream would come out true or false , it calmed me down a bit .
one verse of quran that i learned in the religion class ‚Ä¶ , i murmured it .
a cool breeze was messing my hair .
kite running is like this ; you thought would go with the kite anywhere it goes .
in down and up of the street , the kite runners were coming back victoriously and were showing off their trophy kites .
i have done the whole thing .
hassan said : i counted eleven units .
i never saw myself so dominant and so lucky this is so addictive .
the damn music .
and suddenly the hope gave it place to knowledge very easily .
the crowd thought that we are close to the end .
hassan was screaming and had his hands ring around my neck .
the breeze had messed his light brown hair .
i am dressing up i am waiting for dad i am letting it go .
as hassan was leaving my embrace , he said : i know , god willing , we will party later .
as i was pulling my kite down , people gathered around me to congratulate me .
he brought out his hand toward from between the bars and said : congratulation .
all the heads turned toward me and eyes were fixed on me .
four blocks down from us , i saw omar , the son of the engineer that was my dad's friend .
i meant those small narrow eyes , how can he see anything at all .
someone pull up the curtain from the back of the truck and three heads came in .
his eyes were fixed on a young woman , who was wearing a black shawl around her head and neck .
the young lady covered her face with the shawl .
at the same time , my father got up .
in the war , shame and modesty have no meaning .
what is he saying ?
i saw assef's chubby muscles that with each move would contract and expand .
he faced the soldier with the grin on his lips .
it was from upward mouth of his pistol that smoke was going up .
father looked down to the young officer as a father who is angry of his son's deviance .
one hour before sunrise , we arrived at jalalabad .
baba's hands were ringed around his neck .
none of the roommates knew , that was why dad never made a joke .
no , it was not the next door it was from downstairs .
karim took himself out of the matter , but he did not say anything .
a weak murmur had been spread out in the basement among that could be heard along with the droplet sound of water that was coming from somewhere ; and something else , a constant khesh khesh .
one of the refugees asked dad why he is not cooperating with others .
however , when he and his father came toward us and i saw karim's face .
karim raised his voice among the crowd and said there is another way .
then he emptied the box and took a fist of earth from the dirt road .
your mouth is closed and your lips had been closed as well , the only thing you can do is to shut the crows noises .
i looked at right , left , up and down , i shook my hand in front of my eyes , but i did not see a bit .
then a miracle occurred .
someone was burping .
hassan and i were standing up to our knees in the meadow ; i am pulling the string and the reel is turning in hassan's calluses hands ; our both eyes were fixed on the kite in the sky .
i did not know which month or even what year it was .
from between his feet i saw that the truck was standing by the road and from its tank more refugees were coming down of the ladder .
someone else said the same thing .
karim screamed with a surprise and took a step back .
father liked the idea of going to america .
in 1980 we were still in kabul that united states announced that he is going to boycott the olympic games in moscow .
most of our neighbors in fremont were bus drivers , police officers , gas stations crew , and single mothers that would get financial support from the department of walfare , exactly the same blue collar people that would not take long to get suffocated under the repression of the raigan's economic policies .
i saw dad passed fremont boulevard without going over the line and he entered fast & easy , a small grocery that was being handled by mr. and mrs. nguyen .
mr. nguyen had his hand around his wife's waist .
father , as he was raising his voice , said : he thinks that i am a thief .
i am taking him home .
i gave mrs. nguyen our address and phone number and i told her to estimate the total damages and loss .
by a knife he would give it a cut and each cut on each bread would raise the flames in his fire place .
a year and a half was passed from our landing on america by the peshawar boeing airplane , but my dad still was not able to adapt to the new life style of this country .
there was no place for my father to mourn for his memories .
peshawar was good for me , not you .
i remembered all of those toy trucks , trains and bicycle that he bought me in kabul now this is america .
dad put the package of food coupons on the table and said : thank you , but i do not want it anymore i always work .
dad steppes out of the welfare office with such a feeling as if he survived the cancer .
he made me to put on that square hat ; he took a picture of me with the time tower as its background .
help me , i save some money and maybe next year i go to college .
i said addressing to everyone and no one : i am so happy tonight .
men were shaking hands with him and would give him a friendly tap at his back .
dad ordered another round of beer for everyone .
he put his hand in his pocket and took out a set of keys .
there were tears in his eyes and i was happy that the shadows were covering our faces .
instead of these , i repeated : thank you .
he was drinking a cold tea and chewing seed cloves , which he believes it is the sure cure for a headache caused by hangover .
they will pay for this job , making stories .
he took a deep breath and drank the sip of tea .
most of the back doors in our neighborhood would be closed by gray pencil colored hand rails equipped with a chain .
the first time that i saw the pacific ocean , the tears filled my eyes .
the america was different .
we sat on our chairs and laughed so much that tears were coming down from our cheeks and more importantly , we made sure that neighbors are not watching us anymore .
we were haggling over old sewing machine , one eye dolls , wooden tennis rockets , wireless guitars and old vacuum cleaner .
except tea , the only other thing that was common among those passage ways was rumors .
he was wearing cologne and a pair of lead color trousers with vest that were shinned out because of too much ironing ; and there was a gold pocket watch hung from his vest .
well , people need stories to entertain them in such a difficult year and time .
his way of talking reminded me of the way he dressed : used and unusually glittering .
she was standing behind us a black velvet hair beauty with slim waist , which has a open flask and disposable cup in her hands .
farther down the passage , she went toward her dark gray Pickup Station and put the flask inside .
i struggled with myself for the rest of the day to do not look toward that gray Pickup Station .
i narrowed my eyes .
dad sighed .
ali swears that if one eats watermelons on yalda night , the longest night of the year , one would never get thirsty for the rest the next summer .
i was taking extreme caution to do not get caught as i was looking at soraya , who was sitting and reading a soft cover book .
even though , the sun was burning skin like a hot rod , the bazaar was very crowded that day and sales were great , it was 12 : 30 pm and by that time we had earned $ 160 .
honor and pride pashtun men chanting .
she was alone and was reading book .
my ears were burning .
now i am going .
i hold my breath in my chest .
but i asked her something that if she would answer , we would be .
when he saw us , his eyes were continuously fixed on soraya and me .
you know , your grandfather , judge shahib , judge .
but he did not say more ; dad knew well that one nonsense world behind a young girl how badly can put her future in danger .
it is fresh and delicious .
i wanted to make up something , but she bit a peach and waved .
as if his presence would give legitimate aspect to what had happened between us ; of course , not as much as the presence of the general .
my mother was a teacher , she used to teach persian and history in girls high school of zarghoona in kabul .
he smiled so widely that some wrinkle start to appear around his eyes .
i remembered how i used my literacy to mock hassan .
i took out some stapled , folded papers from my pants back pocket .
she said : such a beautiful day , isn't it .
you know , my child , i become interested in you .
he put down his hand and smiled again .
the sneeze went away , but the coughing still remains .
even though , he was the manager of the gas station , the owner did not medically insure him and dad did not care to persist in this matter .
he sketched some things again .
he handed me the reference paper .
i use it instead of prayer carpet .
doctor schneider said russian .
i'm sorry , doctor i don't think that our works would go anywhere .
doctor amini bit his lips ; he used the word tomb .
do not argue with me while others are present , amir .
what about me , dad ? what should i do ? my eye got wet .
all these years i tried to teach you to never ask such a question .
i did not know with what or whom i should fight .
general , who was always a diplomat , came to me with a smile and two hand handshaking to make a conversation with me .
sometimes in the second hand bazar , the afghani acquaintances would say things about dad's losing weight .
i ran toward dad .
he had bitten his tongue .
he placed the pictures on a bright board in the salon and with an eraser at the end of his pencil he showed dad's cancer spot , like a police who demonstrates the position of killer's shot to the family of the victim .
i spend the night on the chair by dad's bed .
general responded to his smile .
he was looking at me in a strange way and with eyes full of kindness .
his hair was fallen around his head .
our first touch .
she turned to go .
i thanked them , signed the papers , and by the ford torino , i took dad home .
i sat by him .
then hand me the phone .
he listened for a second .
there is a good deed waiting in the way .
i helped him to wear a white shirt , i tied his tie and i realized how large the collar and the shoulders of the shirt have become for him .
i helped dad to get off the ford and then i turned back on the wheels .
it was dad .
i passed the phone to my other hand .
you should know .
it is almost on month that we live together .
i heard that he put down the phone .
he hesitated .
i still want you to be my wife .
i fixed my tie in the front car's mirror .
i heard a feminine voice who was saying : they arrived the talks have stopped .
a portrait of general with military uniform as he was shaking hand with shah hussein , the leader of jordan , was salient .
my dad and i sat side by side each other in the crowded room , in front of the general and his wife .
dad cleared his throat .
dear amir , my only son .
i always admired you in kabul humbly and i still do .
he was wearing the salient , vinaceous afghani shirt that had long sleeves with golden sewn corners .
he would come after the engagement period which surely would take some months .
he rented a magnificent afghani catering hall in fremont the owner was one of dad's acquaintances in kabul , so he gave him great discounts .
we swear and signed the documents .
when we were walking step by step , one of soraya's cousins , dear sharif's son , elevated a quran above our head .
the tea tray passed around the room again and the music started to play , until the neighbors called the police .
there was a relatively great group of dogs .
one hair dressing store .
send hair dresser to concord .
after some while , a sixty years old , dignified man with the formal brown clothing , which seemed to be worn out but was taken a good care of .
as if he fortified his dignity for a continued struggle with shame and unstable turbulence flames .
he was like a white wave that would breaks on the shores by the inn .
perhaps the second hand worries and concerns could be worn and taken off like second hand clothes on a human .
please , let me know .
in the recent years , no .
three times , means if you even say one hundred and fifty years , you would not be far from the truth .
his head was immersed in the chalky rocks .
the air within the city was so full of fish odor as if the ailing fish went to swim as human go to swim in the sea .
since morning little by little was gone .
he had filled the last cup with a face full of satisfaction as the sound of a carriage wheel filled the narrow street and suddenly rushed to the inn's area , roaring .
they did not need anything else anymore .
the heavy and dark tables were accumulated .
this girl was not probably older than 17 years old .
the mirror was framed with a row of black skin cupids , broken hands and legs without head , presented their black sea fruits in black baskets to the black gods , vanished quickly .
every command must be fulfilled .
ms. manette , as it was the custom of the young ladies on those days , kneeled before mr. lorry in respect , to express that she knows him as much wiser and experienced than her .
the noble man had left the london .
naturally , i am so eager to hear the details .
the young woman raised her hand .
whatever you desire .
mr. lorry apparently took the meaning of the word that the young woman had repeated by mistake , said .
like monsieur manette , your father , this man was also from bouvet .
we are talking about twenty years ago , madam .
gradually i am about to think .
sometimes he used his right hand to scratch his chin , sometimes to fix his wig , and some other times to emphasize a point .
feelings .
but the difference starts from here .
a matter of business .
if at that time the wife of this physician had gone to the king to esteghayeh and would fall upon the queen's feet and would ask for the support of the royal court , if she had asked the assistance of clergies to get any news from her husband and she did not get anywhere .
you stayed calm .
well madam , if this poor woman had went through so much pain before her child's birth .
let us be frank , capitan .
his hands , which were still enwrapping mr. lorry's wrist , were to strengthen the foundation more than ever .
when he died .
you know well that my parents were not so wealthy .
he has changed a lot .
the girl with a down and awe struck voice , but defined , as if she is talking in sleep , is saying .
mr. lorry in order to focus the attention of the young woman said with stress .
it is the best that this matter stays right here and never be raised up in anywhere else or for any reason .
he did not understand a word i said .
thus , he asked for help with high raised voice without even making a move .
why , take a full look at yourself .
he would play her as terms such as my jewel and my bird .
while the strong woman .
the stout lady responded .
now , he was fallen on the pavement by the pub's door in the street like a broken nutshell .
even the women's scarves that had forced the thirst in children's mouths .
much mud has been withdrawn .
which one did it show , especially among the lucky guys .
this play stopped as unexpectedly as it occurred .
this thing had stained a lot of hands as well as faces .
among these , a tall humorous guy .
it was very dark .
the wind clouted the clothes every where they were hanged .
it was hunger that kept repeating in each chip of log that the male carpenter was cutting .
the house of this hunger was a deserving one in every aspect .
the signs that could be seen from the top of the stores , which their numbers were not less than the stores themselves , were all funk images of some kind of need .
it suddenly stops .
it elevates loads .
elevating men with ropes and spools , so they can glow upon their dark situations .
the people in the store have done it .
what else .
he had half a pair of his muddy shoe in his hand .
because even in that extremely cold day , he did not have his overcoat on .
a man , who one would not insist to face in a narrow pathway that is on both sides of the cliff .
thus the fiance , with his right elbow that was hold by his left hand .
there was another company there .
he made it seem that he did not see those two strangers .
madam defarge that was busy with cleaning her teeth .
i don't understand the sentence .
she elevated her eyebrows to the peak .
she restarted her knitting with absolute composure and stillness .
by our own store .
with all the pleasure , sir .
after they came out of the bar like that , mr. jarvis lorry and miss manette .
in his face there was no longer a trace of good mood or a sign of openness .
so you want to say that he is always lonely .
so awful curse on rounds .
every room's door opened in the public hallway , thus the left over was in its own area .
it remained healthy with that nice weather .
the pub owner was walking steady ahead of them .
monsieur defarge answered with a funky face .
mr. lorry said amazingly .
not even a word was reached to the young girl .
she went upstairs calmly and slowly .
leave us alone , goodbye .
i thought it is good .
he looked out from the cranny of the wall .
a voice answered almost frivolously .
i was afraid of it , he answered , shaking .
he got the key again .
half of this door was closed quickly .
of course the fat man , specially the person whom been fat since childhood , is not completely same as others .
he asked me to visit him .
i look at couple of kites .
he pointed us to climb down the tree by waving his finger .
the tiny ceramics that father bought from isfahan himself could cover 4 bathrooms .
i was sitting next to the door and being sad .
there was an elevated fireplace in the other side of the dining room and its orange flame was dancing in winters .
i was passing through rose gardens , going the father's residence and to the mud brick cottage that hassan was born in and spent his whole life there .
hassan never talked about his mother like she never exists .
hey ! i am with you , i know you .
once i brought him behind river , there .
i whispered in his ear that he got you wrong with someone else , surely got you wrong .
but childhood paralysis left ali a weaken right foot which didn't leave anything but a thin layer of muscle covering the bone which been covered by yellow skin .
but he didn't say anything not at that time , not later .
one day i went to my dad's office , i have searched his bookshelf and i found one of my mom's old history books there .
there was many thing been written in the book that i didn't knew , the things that our teachers didn't mentioned at all .
in despite sharing ethnic heritage and family blood , sanaubar joined the neighborhood kids in taunting ali .
no obstetrician and no anesthesia specialists and no medical devices .
hassan and i , we were always asking even that we knew what he is reading ali told us many times .
but no one were doubting the truth about dad's stories .
rahim khan explained the matter to me .
i was eight those times .
we sat on a bench next to the lake just me and dad , and we ate boiled eggs , meat balls with cucumber pickle and bread the water was dark and reflection of sun was shining on the smooth surface of water .
the sunlight was shining in the mirror next to him .
dad gave me his hat to hold it and i was happy because , everyone could see he's my father .
not only father run the business successfully , but also he proved one of richest businessmen in kabul the everyone are wrong .
one day he told us in islam religion drinking alcohol is a great sin ; and those who drink alcohol should answer their sin in doomsday .
he spoke with rough voice : i see that you mixed the things you have learned in school with practical training , if he was right , you are sinner , dad .
while i was laughing i said : but fatiullah khan looks like a good man .
i want to talk to you like two men .
i didn't want to disappoint him again .
when father was six , at one midnight a burglar entered my grandfather house .
anyone come into my way , god help him out do you understand .
when i was 11 , i memorized tens of lines from khayyam , hafez and rumi's famous masnawi .
now it's something which can attract someone .
when it became clear that i didn't get his talents in sports , he tried to make me a passionate fan .
we were watching from the benches that horse riders were shouting and yelling and from the horses mouths white foam was dripping on the ground .
i remember how dad held the wheel .
dad almost sound very angry .
sometimes i look out from this window and see he is playing with neighbors kids in street .
do you know when other kids bully him what happens .
you take it easy like always .
he started to talk softly , but i still heard .
this boy was the same ali .
anyway , this point that the face of afghanistan looks as a slim boy's face to me , with a shaved head and a flappy corner , a boy with the face of chinese dolls that continue to be adorned with harelip smile .
we were fallowing a group of immigrants , gypsies who were passing northern mountains of kabul .
we were talking about each and every new movie we watched and walking through crowd in chaos of markets .
at one summer day i took one of ali's kitchen knives and carved our names on it , amir and hassan sultans of kabul .
we were sitting hours under that tree till sunset , but still hassan was insisting that we still have time to read another story or another chapter .
i said : so , in our school everyone know what it means .
i told myself this is enough to cover an effect of harmless prank .
however , doesn't every father secretly wants to kill his son .
i said : what are you clapping for .
i have read lots of stories for him .
it took half an hour .
his direct look , caused my throat to dry .
weather was heavy , humid and firm .
father shrugged and stood up .
he winked , while he had a smile on his lips .
i really enjoyed your story .
bravo , your friend , rahim .
when story ended , he clapped silently .
i left his speech incomplete .
but i never finished my sentences .
ali put his hands around both of us .
hassan was crying .
and if he had not finished his work completely , at least he was about to finish .
we have let him to hug us , and for short moments i have felt insanely happy from the things happened that night .
i shrugged , i don't know .
i laughed more loadly .
assef and his two friends , wali and kamal , were getting close to us .
once i saw that guy from karate neighborhood with brass knuckles what should be done .
three tall guys in t shirts and jeans stood in front of us .
in fact i didn't know that , this is true or not .
i told the same thing that told him to my mom , about hitler .
i didn't know who he means and why they hide the fact and i didn't want to know .
anyway he was telling me ; assef always answers his own questions .
i am saying afghanistan is for pashtuns .
i hated the vibration in my voice , i said : let us go assef .
wali and kamal shake their heads and yelled that they agree .
but if it was like this , so why , when dad's friends kids were coming to our place , we wouldn't mix with hassan .
really he wanted to hurt me .
there was an stone in size of a walnut in the cup .
may you didn't understand , but we are three and you are two .
he said it so calm , that i had to put on pressure to recognize the fear which been hidden beyond that calm voice .
maybe the thing he saw in hassan's face convinced him that he is not joking because he bring his first down .
i saw them coming down the hill and disappearing behind a wall .
for a short time the whole land became more fresh and targeted .
the next year in 1974 early winter , hassan and i were playing in the yard one day and we were busy of building a snow castle .
insists , come on , ali , say it .
he asked hassan for a while that what he wants , but after a while he stopped asking .
hassan and i exchanged staggered looks .
father stared at ali's opaque and prudent eyes .
we both stair at ali , but it was clear that he wouldn't tell us anything .
he cleared him .
the doctor gave same answer and assured me that i wouldn't feel any pain .
when hassan took a long look with deep taught to his lips , ali has been held his .
it didn't take so long that waved line becomes visible on his lips .
i put some snow in my mouth and listen to a suffocated silence beaten only by caw of crows .
for a few unfortunate kids , winter was not the end of school year .
i waited until they pulled away and turned the corner , then i would slip back into bed in my flannel pajamas .
kites were the paper thin slice of intersection between these two areas .
for sometime we made our own kites .
the next day we would wind the battle ready thread around a wooden spool .
but he made the best kites in the city he , lived in a tiny hut on maywand road , a crowded street in south of muddy beach of kabul river .
people gathered on sidewalks and on roofs to cheer for their sons .
afghans like customs but hate rules .
one year a neighborhood boy climbed a pine tree to bring down a kite .
stretched muscles were ready to uncoil .
i was chasing hassan through neighborhoods , jumping over gutters and weaving through narrow streets .
i saw we had got on a rutted dirt road near isteqial high school .
hassan popped a berry in his mouth .
would you do it .
we were two boys sitting under a sour cherry tree , suddenly we looked at each other , we really looked .
until now i find it hard to stare directly at people like hassan , people who believe in what they say .
hassan responded to my smile .
but they were wasting their time .
one night in winter just four days from the big contest , father and i were sitting in his study in the stuffed leather chairs by the glow of the fireplace .
in fact he was a rough opponent .
i pretended to listen .
i let myself dream : i imagined conversation and laughter over dinner instead of the silence broken only by clinking of silverware and occasional grunt .
i nodded my head and smiled just at the right time .
Hassan put away the six and took jack .
i remembered something my teacher had said about iranians last summer , they grin at those who pat you in the back and then pick your pocket .
Hassan said : i will put it on my table , where i put my paintings .
i took the king and with my last card , meaning the Ace of spades .
he explained : me and you and father and Agha Sahib , Rahim Khan and thousands of people were at Ghargha lake .
i will show you all and before anyone can stop you , you jumped into water and started swimming .
now they all knew .
i sipped some tea .
i could hear father taking a bath upstairs .
kids were throwing snow balls , screaming , chasing one another , and giggling .
he wore black rubber snow boots , and a light green chapan over the worn out corduroy pants .
this lost was in huge scale , even for me .
there is no monster , today is just a beautiful day .
he closed his eyes .
this dream , whether true or false , had lightened my anxiety .
when the verse in the Quran class ‚Ä¶ , i recited it .
a cool breeze disheveled my hair .
kite flying is like this , your mind drifts with the kite .
up and down the street kite runners were returning triumphantly , exhibiting their captured kites .
i did it to the end .
Hassan said : i counted eleven .
i had never been so much in control and fortunate , i felt intoxicated .
the damn music .
and suddenly quite simply hoped transformed into knowledge .
the crowd sensed that the end is close .
Hassan was screaming and his hands were around my neck .
the breeze wetted through his light brown hair .
i get dressed wait for father heave him .
Hassan breaking my embrace , said : inshallah , we will celebrate later .
i began to pull back my kite , when people gathered around me to congratulate .
he passed his hands through the bars and said : congratulations .
the heads turned on my direction and the eyes stared at me .
four streets down , i saw Omar , the son of an engineer who was dad's friend .
i mean how could he see anything with those tight little eyes .
someone flung open the tarpaulin which was hanging over the back of the truck and three heads came in .
his eyes were fixed on the young woman wearing the black shawl over her head and neck .
the young woman pulled down the shawl over her face .
it was then , that father stood up .
in war prudency is meaningless .
what does he say ?
Assef's buttock muscles contracted and expanded with each move .
he faced the soldier with a grin .
smoke came out from the muzzle of his upturned gun .
he gave the younger officer a condemning look of a father who is outrageous with his sons bad manners .
we reached Jalalabad an hour before sunrise .
father's hands were gripped around his neck .
none of the roommates knew , that father was not joking at all .
no , not the adjacent room , from below .
Karim pulled back , but did not say a thing .
there was a low murmur in the basement and water drops tricking somewhere was heard ; and something else too , a scratching sound .
one of the refugees asked father , why doesn't he join them .
but when he and his son came towards us and then i saw Kamal's face .
Karim raised his voice amidst all the grumbling and said : there is another way too .
then he emptied the box and grabbed a handful of soil from the middle of the dirt road .
your mouth is closed , your lips are tightened the only thing you can do is to repress the croak's sound .
i looked to right and left , up and down , moved my hands in front of my eyes , but i didn't see a copy at all .
then a miracle happened .
someone vomited .
Hassan and i are ankle deep in wild grass ; i am pulling on the line and the pool spinning in hassan's calloused hands ; our eyes gazed at the kite in the sky .
i don't know , which month or even which year it was .
through the upside down 7 between his legs , i saw the truck parked by the road and other refugees climbed down the tanker's ladder .
someone else said the same thing too .
Karim screamed in amazement and retreated a step .
father liked the idea of going to america .
in 1980 when we were still in Kabol , US had announced that they boycott the Moscow olympic games .
most of our neighbors in fremont were bus drivers , policemen , gas station attendants , single mothers who got welfare , exactly the sort of blue collar folks who would suffocate under economical policies of Regan .
i saw father jaywalking across fremont boulevard and enter fast and easy little store , which was run by an old Vietnamese couple , mr. and mrs. Nguyen .
mr. Nguyen's hands were around his wife's hips .
father whose voice was raising , said : he thinks i am a thief .
i will take him home .
i gave mrs. Nguyen our telephone number and address and told her to get an estimate for the damages .
using a knife be put a piece on it , each notch for a piece of bread which he pulled from tandoor which had high flames .
a year and a half had passed since we had come from Peshawar by a boeing to America and father had not adjusted himself to life in this country .
it was a place for father to mourn for his memories .
Peshawar was good for me , not for you .
i remembered all the toys , vans , trains and bicycles that father had bought for me in Kabol , now this is america .
father put the stack of food stamps on the desk and said : thank you , but i don't want it anymore i will always work .
father left the welfare office as if he has been cured of cancer .
to put on my mortarboard and took a picture of me with the school clock tower in the background .
to help , save some money and maybe go to college next year .
speaking to all and no one specific he said : tonight i am overjoyed .
men shook hands with him and patted him on the back friendly .
father ordered another round of beer for all .
he put his hand inside his pocket and brought out a bunch of keys .
my eyes were filled with tears and i was happy that the shadows hide our faces .
instead of these i repeated again : thanks .
he was drinking cold tea and chewing cardamom seeds , which he believed was the cure for hangover headaches .
they pay you for making stories .
he breathed deeply and sipped his tea .
most of the backdoors of our neighborhood were closed by gray chain fences .
the first time i saw the ocean , my eyes were filled with tears .
america was different .
we sat in our seats , laughed until tears rolled down our checks and more important , until we were sure the neighbors were not watching anymore .
we bargained over old sewing machine , one eyed Barbie dolls , wooden tennis rackets , stringless guitars and old Electrolux vacuum cleaner .
the only thing beside that tea was spoken of , was gossip .
he smelled like cologne , wore an iron gray three piece suit shiny from ironing and a gold chain dangled from his vest .
well , people need stories to get them through harsh times .
this way of speaking , reminded me his way of clothing , over used and unnaturally shiny .
he was standing behind us , a slim hipped beauty with velvety black hair who was holding an open flask and a styrofoam cup in her hand .
she walked two blocks towards a gray station van and put the flask inside it .
the rest of the day i was fighting with myself not to look at the gray van .
i rolled my eyes .
father sighed .
ali swore that if you ate watermelon on yalda night , you would not get thirsty on the coming summer .
i always checked myself when looking at soraya who was reading a paperback , not to be caught unguard .
although the sun was burning us like a hot iron , the flea market was busy and the sale was good it was 12 : 30 and we had earned $ 160 .
honor and pride motto of pashton men .
he was alone and was reading a book .
my ears were burning .
i am leaving .
i held my breath .
i had asked her something that if she would answer , we .
when he saw us , her eyes turned from soraya to me repeatedly .
did you know , your grandfather , judge shahib , judge .
but didn't say anymore , father well know that gossip about a girl , could easily ruin her future .
they are delicious and fresh .
i wanted to make up something , but he bit a peach and waved his hand .
as if her presence would legalize what was happening between us ‚Äì although not as if general was present .
my mother was a teacher too , she taught persian and history in zarghoona high school for girls in kabul .
she smiled broadly and her eyes wrinkled .
i remembered how i used my literacy to humiliate hassan .
i brought out few stapled pages out of my trouser's back pocket .
said : it is a beautiful day , isn't it .
you know , my child , i have grown fond of you .
he dropped his hand and smiled again .
the sneezing stopped but the coughing didn't .
although he was the manager of the gas station , the owner hadn't health insured father and father carelessly hadn't insisted on being insured .
again he scribbled somethings .
he gave me the appointment card .
i used it instead of prayer's rug .
dr. schneider said : russian .
sorry doctor but we are not getting anywhere .
dr. amini bit his lip , he used the word grave .
don't confront me in front of the others .
what about me , what should i do daddy ? my eyes were wet .
all these years i have tried to teach you not to ask such questions .
i didn't know , who or what was he challenging .
general who has always been a diplomat ; smiled , shook my hand with both of his hands and started to chat with me .
sometimes at the ragmans market afghan acquaintances made remarks about baba's weight loss .
i run toward baba .
he had bit his tongue .
he put the films up on a viewing box in the hallway and pointed with the eraser end of his penal to the pictures of dad's cancer , like a cop showing mug shots of the killer to the victim's family .
i spent the night beside father's bed .
general returned his smile too .
he was looking strangely at me and his eyes were fulled with kindness .
her hair was around her head .
our first contact .
he came back to leave .
i thanked them , signed the forms , and took baba home in my ford torino .
i sat next to him .
then give me the phone .
he listened for a few minutes .
a suiting ceremony is on the way .
i helped him into a white shirt and knotted his tie then i realized how loose his color and shoulders had became .
i helped father to get out of the ford , then i went inside and sat behind the wheel .
it was dad .
the phone was handed down .
you should know .
we lived together for almost a month .
i heard him , putting down the phone .
he paused .
i still want you , to be my wife .
i checked my tie in the rearview mirror .
i heard a woman's voice say , they have arrived the chatter inside stopped .
a photo of the general in full military outfit was fascinating , he was shaking hands with king hussein of jordan a photograph of zahir shah .
baba and i sat in the crowded room , in front of general and his wife .
father cleared his throat too .
amirjan , my only son .
i was your humble admirer in kabul and i am still today .
she was wearing a magnificent wine colored traditional afghan dress which had long sleeves and gold trimmings .
then and engagement period which lasted few months , would follow .
he rented a large afghan banquet hall in fremont the owner know baba from kabul and gave father a huge discount .
we said our vows and signed the documents .
as we walked step by step , one of soraya's cousins ; the son of sharif jan , held quran over our head .
again tea was served and music played ; until the neighbors called the police .
it was almost a great pack of dogs .
a hairdresser .
send the hairdresser to concord .
when after a while a sixty year old gentleman who wore a worn out brown formal suit , that had been well kept .
it seems as if he has challenged his nobleness and constancy with levity and the inconstancy of the untamed flames have evoked him .
like the huge white tides beside of the tavern the move and hit the seaside .
maybe the second hand anxieties like second hand clothes are easily worn and easily put off .
please let me know .
in the recent years , no .
three folds which means a hundred and fifty years , is not far from truth .
he had dipped his head on the chalk cliffs .
the air was jilled with the smell of fish , as if the sick fish had swam in it , like people who go swimming in the sea .
when the morning came slowly to the end .
he filled the last glass with contentment when the sound of a carriage was heard in the narrow bend which was getting near the tavern loudly .
they didn't need anything else .
black , heavy tables were abundant .
she wasn't more than seventeen .
the mirror was framed with a row of black skin cupids , broken hands and legs without head , presented their black sea fruits in black baskets to the black gods , vanished quickly .
every order will be carried out .
miss manette , as the custom of that time was , bent her knees in respect , to show mr. lorry that she assumes him more wiser and experienced than herself .
the nobleman had left london .
in fact i was quite eager to hear the details of that .
the young woman raised her hand .
as you wish .
it seemed mr. Lorry had misunderstood the word which the young woman had repeated .
like mr. Manette , your father , this man is also from Beauvais .
madam we are talking about 20 years ago .
i am thinking little by little .
he used his right hand to scratch his jaw , fixing his hairpiece and in emphasizing on a point .
feelings .
but the difference starts from here .
an element is work and business .
if at the time the wife of the doctor had gone to the king for implored and had asked the queen for aid and had asked all the royal court for assistance and then went to the clergymen to help her find her husband , hadn't succeeded .
you have kept calm .
well miss , if this miserable woman had suffered so much before her child's birth .
let us be frank colonel .
his hands were still squeezing mr. lorry's wrist , to push further the stand .
when he died .
you know your parents didn't have much money .
he has changed greatly .
the girl with a dull and astonished , but clear , as if speaking in sleep .
to concentrate the young woman's mind , mr. lorry said with emphasize .
the best thing to do is not to discuss this matter anywhere and anyway .
he didn't understand even a word of what i said .
because of that , without moving at all , he screamed for help .
why , look at yourself carefully .
he called her with phrases like my jewel and my bird .
while the stout woman .
the stout woman answered .
now , he had collapsed down in front of the tavern on the cobblestones in the street like a crashed nut .
even the neckwear from woman's head , that forced hunger into children's mouths .
lots of mud was dragged out with it .
which one did he show , especially within the fortunate ones .
this play stopped suddenly as it had suddenly started .
this had stained many hands , also , many faces .
from these , a tall humorous one .
the darkness wasn't too deep .
suspended on any hanger , which the wind swung .
the hunger was repeated in each splint of the wood that the carpenter cut down .
the site of this hunger was righty appointed .
all the signs at the top of the stores which were as many as the stores , were all pictures of the glum necessities .
suddenly the door of the entrances were shut down .
at the moment he takes the cargo upstairs .
pulling up the men with their ropes and reels , so to conquer their dark situation .
the people of the store done it .
what else .
he was holding an odd pair of his muddy shoe .
because , even in that very cold day , he had not put on an overcoat .
a man which no one persists to encounter in a tight alleyway with cliffs to both sides .
so the nominee , with his right arm , that was hold by his left arm .
there was another firm there .
however , he pretended he hasn't seen the two strangers .
madam defarge was still flossing her teeth .
the last of the three now said his say , he put down his empty bottle and tasted his lips noisily .
he kept his eyebrows to the highest point .
she resumed her knitting with great calm and tranquility .
near the window of our store .
with pleasure , sir .
after mr. jarvis lorry and miss manette left the tavern like that .
there were no traces of bless or cheerfulness in his face anymore .
you want to say that he is always alone .
he uttered a dreadful curse .
the room or rooms which their door opened into the public stairway , left its garbage in its own area .
with any faded nice weather that were remained healthy .
the owner of the tavern which constantly walked ahead of them .
monsieur defarge answered with a glum face .
mr. lorry said with astonishment .
she didn't even hear a word of that .
quietly and slowly they went upstairs .
leave us , goodbye .
i thought this is good .
he looked through the crack of the wall .
a slightly faint voice answered .
i was afraid of that , he responded , shaking .
he reclaimed the key .
half of the door was quickly shut .
